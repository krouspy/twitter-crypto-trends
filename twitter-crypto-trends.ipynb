The general idea is to analyze tweets and categorize them depending whether they are in favor or not for a given cryptocurrency. The first step is to retrieve tweets, we will use [snscrape](https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape) to scrape tweets. Then, for each tweet, we will apply a sentiment analysis using the [natural language toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/) python package."
